        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
<li>Whisk eggs, half-and-half, and a pinch of salt together in a small bowl.</li>
<li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick pan over medium-low heat. When butter starts to bubble, pour in egg mixture. Using a silicone spatula, gently swirl the eggs around in circles from the outside in, without stopping, until you start to see small curds, about 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Switch from making circles to making long sweeps across the pan until you see larger curds, about 20 seconds. When eggs are about 75% cooked, gently fold in cheese. The eggs now should be softly set and still a little runny in places. </li>

<li>Remove the skillet from the heat, and set aside for about 20 to 35 seconds to allow the residual heat to finish cooking to your preferred consistency.</li>
<li>Garnish with parsley or chives, and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
